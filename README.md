# What is this ??

A simple proof of concept for NFTs that disappear after a certain amount of time. Anyone can create a NFT Snap and share with the world. Anyone is able to collect (mint) a Snap but the image and metadata visibility will expire.

- Collecting a Snap is only open for 24 hours after creation
- A Snap is only visible for 48 hours after creation
- Allows for a mint fee
- Allows for a mint price
- Token can be burned permissionlessly after visibility expires
